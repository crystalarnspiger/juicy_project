Please note that the data is not perfectly clean. I did do some cleanup, ignoring parenthetical ingredients and treating anything with Natural Flavors in the name as just Natural Flavors. Of course these are the kind of decisions that I would discuss with any product owners and/or clients in a real production application.

I would also not normally add a database to the repo but because it was simpler to do so for these purposes and the database was not large, I did so in this case.
